            <h2>1. Breast Cancer</h2>
            <div style="text-align: center; margin-top: 20px">
                <img style="max-width: 600px" src="static/img/breastcancer.jpg" /><br/><br/>
            </div>
            <p>Breast cancer is cancer that develops from breast tissue. Signs of breast cancer may include a lump in the breast, a change in breast shape, dimpling of the skin, fluid coming from the nipple, a newly inverted nipple, or a red or scaly patch of skin.</p>

            <h3>Symptoms</h3>
            <p>Signs and symptoms of breast cancer may include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>A breast lump or thickening that feels different from the surrounding tissue</li>
                <li>Change in the size, shape or appearance of a breast</li>
                <li>Changes to the skin over the breast, such as dimpling</li>
                <li>A newly inverted nipple</li>
                <li>Peeling, scaling, crusting or flaking of the pigmented area of skin surrounding the nipple (areola) or breast skin</li>
                <li>Redness or pitting of the skin over your breast, like the skin of an orange</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Causes</h3>
            <p>Doctors know that breast cancer occurs when some breast cells begin to grow abnormally. These cells divide more rapidly than healthy cells do and continue to accumulate, forming a lump or mass. Cells may spread (metastasize) through your breast to your lymph nodes or to other parts of your body. Breast cancer most often begins with cells in the milk-producing ducts (invasive ductal carcinoma). Breast cancer may also begin in the glandular tissue called lobules (invasive lobular carcinoma) or in other cells or tissue within the breast.</p>
            <p>Researchers have identified hormonal, lifestyle, and environmental factors that may increase your risk of breast cancer. But it's not clear why some people who have no risk factors develop cancer, yet other people with risk factors never do. It's likely that breast cancer is caused by a complex interaction of your genetic makeup and your environment.</p>

            <h2>2. Brain Tumor</h2>
            <div style="text-align: center; margin-top: 20px">
                <img style="max-width: 600px" src="static/img/Brain.jpg" /><br/><br/>
            </div>
            <p>A brain tumor is a mass or growth of abnormal cells in your brain. Many different types of brain tumors exist. Some brain tumors are noncancerous (benign), and some brain tumors are cancerous (malignant).</p>

            <h3>Symptoms</h3>
            <p>Symptoms of brain tumors can vary based on the tumor's size, type, and location. Common signs and symptoms include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>New or changing headaches</li>
                <li>Unexplained nausea or vomiting</li>
                <li>Vision problems, such as blurred vision, double vision, or loss of peripheral vision</li>
                <li>Gradual loss of sensation or movement in an arm or a leg</li>
                <li>Difficulty with balance</li>
                <li>Speech difficulties</li>
                <li>Confusion in everyday matters</li>
                <li>Personality or behavior changes</li>
                <li>Seizures, especially in someone who doesn't have a history of seizures</li>
                <li>Hearing problems</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Causes</h3>
            <p>The exact cause of brain tumors is not clear. They can be primary, originating in the brain, or secondary, spreading to the brain from other parts of the body. Genetic and environmental factors, exposure to radiation, and family history can increase the risk of brain tumors.</p>

            <h2>3. Heart Disease</h2>
            <div style="text-align: center; margin-top: 20px">
                <img style="max-width: 600px" src="static/img/heart.png" /><br/>
            </div>

            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>Heart disease describes a range of conditions that affect your heart. Diseases under the heart disease umbrella include blood vessel diseases, such as coronary artery disease; heart rhythm problems (arrhythmias); and heart defects you're born with (congenital heart defects), among others. The term "heart disease" is often used interchangeably with the term "cardiovascular disease." Cardiovascular disease generally refers to conditions that involve narrowed or blocked blood vessels that can lead to a heart attack, chest pain (angina) or stroke. Other heart conditions, such as those that affect your heart's muscle, valves or rhythm, also are considered forms of heart disease. Many forms of heart disease can be prevented or treated with healthy lifestyle choices.</p>

            <h3>Symptoms</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Chest pain, chest tightness, chest pressure and chest discomfort (angina)</li>
                <li>Shortness of breath</li>
                <li>Pain, numbness, weakness or coldness in your legs or arms if the blood vessels in those parts of your body are narrowed</li>
                <li>Pain in the neck, jaw, throat, upper abdomen or back</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>4. Liver Disease</h2>
            <div style="text-align: center; margin-top: 20px">
                <img style="max-width: 600px" src="static/img/liver.png" /><br/>
            </div>

            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>Liver disease is any disturbance of liver function that causes illness. The liver is responsible for many critical functions within the body and should it become diseased or injured, the loss of those functions can cause significant damage to the body. Liver disease is also referred to as hepatic disease. Liver disease is a broad term that covers all the potential problems that cause the liver to fail to perform its designated functions. Usually, more than 75% or three quarters of liver tissue needs to be affected before a decrease in function occurs.</p>

            <h3>Symptoms</h3>
            <p>Classic symptoms of liver disease include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Nausea</li>
                <li>Vomiting</li>
                <li>Right upper quadrant abdominal pain</li>
                <li>Jaundice (a yellow discoloration of the skin due to elevated bilirubin concentrations in the bloodstream)</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>5. Pneumonia</h2>
            <div style="text-align: center; margin-top: 20px">
                <img style="max-width: 600px" src="static/img/Pneumonia.jpg" /><br/><br/>
            </div>

            <p>Pneumonia is an infection that inflames the air sacs in one or both lungs. The air sacs may fill with fluid or pus (purulent material), causing cough with phlegm or pus, fever, chills, and difficulty breathing. A variety of organisms, including bacteria, viruses, and fungi, can cause pneumonia.</p>

            <h3>Symptoms</h3>
            <p>Symptoms of pneumonia can range from mild to severe and may include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Chest pain when you breathe or cough</li>
                <li>Confusion or changes in mental awareness (in adults age 65 and older)</li>
                <li>Cough, which may produce phlegm</li>
                <li>Fatigue</li>
                <li>Fever, sweating, and shaking chills</li>
                <li>Lower than normal body temperature (in adults older than age 65 and people with weak immune systems)</li>
                <li>Nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea</li>
                <li>Shortness of breath</li>
